## Answer Key

1.  d) Abstract Learning
2.  b) To classify network traffic as either benign or malicious.
3.  c) To craft and send custom network packets.
4.  A TCP SYN scan (or half-open scan) sends a SYN packet and waits for a SYN-ACK response to identify an open port, but does not complete the three-way handshake. A TCP connect scan completes the full three-way handshake, which is more easily detected and logged.
5.  c) It can automatically learn features from raw data.
6.  Static analysis examines a malware sample without executing it, looking at its code and structure. Dynamic analysis involves running the malware in a controlled environment (a sandbox) to observe its behavior.
7.  b) Detecting malicious URLs in phishing emails.
8.  A confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of a classification model's performance, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
9.  Feature engineering is crucial because the quality and relevance of the features directly impact the performance of the machine learning model. Well-engineered features can help the model better distinguish between benign and malicious activity.
10. Defense in depth is a strategy that involves layering multiple security controls and countermeasures to protect an asset. If one layer fails, another layer is in place to thwart the attack.
