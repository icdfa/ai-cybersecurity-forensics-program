# Quarter 1, Month 2: Data for Threat Intelligence & ML for Threat Prediction

## Overview

This month focuses on collecting, processing, and analyzing threat intelligence data. Students learn to build data pipelines for threat intelligence and develop machine learning models for threat prediction.

## Lab Assignments

### Lab 2: Developing a Threat Intelligence Data Pipeline (Weeks 5-6)

Build a system to collect threat intelligence from public APIs, normalize the data, and store it in a structured database.

**Topics Covered:**
- Threat intelligence APIs and data sources
- Data collection and normalization
- SQLite database design and management
- Data querying and analysis
- Threat intelligence enrichment

**Deliverables:**
- Python script for threat intelligence pipeline
- SQLite database with collected data
- Lab report with analysis and insights

**Grading:** 100 points

See [lab2_threat_intel_pipeline.md](lab2_threat_intel_pipeline.md) for complete details.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this month, students will be able to:

- Collect threat intelligence data from public APIs
- Parse and normalize data from different sources
- Store structured data in a local database
- Build a simple data pipeline for continuous threat intelligence gathering
