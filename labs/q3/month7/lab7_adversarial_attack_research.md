# Lab 7: Research and Presentation on Recent Adversarial Attacks

## Quarter 3, Month 7, Weeks 25-26

### Objective

This lab requires you to conduct in-depth research on a recent, real-world adversarial attack against an AI system. You will analyze the attack, its impact, and the defensive measures. The goal is to deepen your understanding of the adversarial AI threat landscape and to develop your research and presentation skills.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:

-   Identify and describe various types of real-world adversarial attacks.
-   Analyze the technical details and consequences of a specific attack.
-   Critically evaluate the effectiveness of existing defense mechanisms.
-   Communicate complex technical concepts clearly and effectively in both written and oral formats.

### Prerequisites

-   A solid understanding of the taxonomy of adversarial attacks (evasion, poisoning, etc.).
-   Familiarity with the concepts of machine learning and deep learning.

### Task Description

1.  **Form a Team:** This is a group project. Form a team of 2-3 students.

2.  **Select an Attack:** Choose a well-documented adversarial attack on a real-world AI system that has occurred in the last 2-3 years. Examples of areas to research include:
    *   Adversarial attacks on autonomous vehicles (e.g., tricking lane detection systems).
    *   Evasion of spam or malware classifiers.
    *   Data poisoning attacks on recommendation systems.
    *   Model inversion or membership inference attacks on facial recognition systems.
    *   Attacks on large language models (LLMs) leading to harmful content generation.

3.  **Conduct In-Depth Research:** Your research should cover the following aspects of the chosen attack:
    *   **The Target System:** What was the AI system, and what was its purpose?
    *   **The Attack:** How was the attack carried out? What specific techniques were used?
    *   **The Impact:** What were the consequences of the attack? (e.g., financial loss, privacy violation, safety risks).
    *   **The Defenses:** What defenses were in place, and why did they fail? What new defenses have been proposed or implemented in response?

4.  **Prepare a Presentation:** Create a 15-20 minute presentation that summarizes your findings. The presentation should be professional, engaging, and technically accurate.

5.  **Write a Research Paper:** Write a 5-7 page research paper that provides a detailed analysis of the attack. The paper should be well-structured, properly referenced, and demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic.

### Suggested Research Sources

-   **Academic Databases:** arXiv, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar.
-   **Security Conferences:** Black Hat, DEF CON, USENIX Security, NeurIPS, ICML.
-   **Cybersecurity News:** Wired, The Hacker News, Bleeping Computer, Dark Reading.
-   **Vendor and Research Blogs:** Google AI, Microsoft Security Research, OpenAI Blog, MITRE ATT&CK for AI.

### Deliverables

1.  **Presentation Slides:** A PDF of your presentation slides.
2.  **Research Paper:** A 5-7 page research paper in PDF format.
