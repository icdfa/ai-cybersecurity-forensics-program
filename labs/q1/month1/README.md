# Quarter 1, Month 1: Python for Cybersecurity & Fundamentals of AI/ML

## Overview

This month introduces students to Python programming for cybersecurity applications and the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Lab Assignments

### Lab 1: Automating Network Scanning and Packet Analysis (Weeks 1-2)

Learn to automate network discovery and port scanning using Python and Scapy. Capture and analyze network packets in real-time.

**Topics Covered:**
- Python scripting for network automation
- Scapy library for packet manipulation
- Host discovery with ARP scanning
- TCP port scanning (SYN scan)
- Packet sniffing and analysis

**Deliverables:**
- Python scripts for network scanning
- Lab report with findings and analysis

**Grading:** 100 points

See [lab1_network_scanning.md](lab1_network_scanning.md) for complete details.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this month, students will be able to:

- Write Python scripts to automate network scanning tasks
- Use Scapy to craft and send custom network packets
- Analyze packet captures to identify network protocols
- Develop a basic port scanner and host discovery tool
