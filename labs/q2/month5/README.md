# Quarter 2, Month 5: Advanced Forensic Analysis with AI & NLP

## Overview

This month focuses on advanced forensic analysis techniques using AI and Natural Language Processing. Students learn to correlate events across multiple data sources and reconstruct attack timelines.

## Lab Assignments

### Lab 5: Automated Attack Timeline Generation (Weeks 17-18)

Build an automated system to parse, correlate, and visualize events from multiple log sources to reconstruct attack timelines.

**Topics Covered:**
- Log parsing and normalization
- Event correlation across data sources
- Timeline reconstruction
- Graph-based attack visualization
- Automated timeline generation

**Deliverables:**
- Python script for timeline generation
- Attack timeline visualization
- Lab report with analysis

**Grading:** 100 points

See [lab5_timeline_generation.md](lab5_timeline_generation.md) for complete details.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this month, students will be able to:

- Parse and normalize log data from multiple sources
- Correlate events based on timestamps and indicators
- Use graph analysis to visualize attack paths
- Automate timeline generation for forensic investigations
