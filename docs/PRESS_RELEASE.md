**[CITY, STATE] – January 17, 2026** – The International Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Academy (ICDFA) today announced the launch of its groundbreaking 12-month intensive program, **Advanced AI in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics**. This comprehensive curriculum, meticulously developed by renowned cybersecurity educator and industry veteran Aminu Idris, AMCPN, is designed to address the critical global shortage of professionals skilled in AI-powered cyber defense and forensic analysis.

This landmark program is made possible through strategic partnerships with the world’s leading technology companies. As a **Microsoft for Azure verified** institution, a member of the **AWS Academy**, a **Cisco Partner**, and a **GitHub Campus approved** school, ICDFA provides students with unparalleled access to enterprise-grade cloud computing resources, official curriculum from Amazon Web Services and Cisco, and the full suite of GitHub developer tools.

In an era where AI-driven cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the ICDFA program provides a production-ready, expert-led educational framework. The curriculum moves beyond theoretical concepts to provide deep, hands-on training across 12 integrated labs, covering everything from AI-powered threat intelligence to advanced adversarial attack simulation and AI security validation.

This program distinguishes itself by being entirely human-crafted and expert-driven. Under the leadership of Aminu Idris, the Founder and Commandant of ICDFA, every module, lab, and assessment has been developed to reflect real-world challenges and industry best practices. This ensures that graduates are equipped with practical, battle-tested skills, not just automated or theoretical knowledge.

"We are facing a new frontier in cyber warfare, and traditional training programs are failing to keep pace," said Aminu Idris. "Our mission is to cultivate the next generation of cybersecurity leaders who can not only defend against AI-driven threats but also leverage AI to create more resilient security postures. Our partnerships with Microsoft, AWS, Cisco, and GitHub are a testament to our commitment to providing world-class resources. We are putting these powerful tools directly into the hands of our trainees to ensure they are fully prepared for the challenges ahead."

Mr. Idris brings a wealth of experience to the program, holding a formidable array of top-tier industry certifications, including CCNA, CompTIA Security+, CEH, OSCP, and CISSP. His role as a cybersecurity educator and mentor has shaped a curriculum that is both academically rigorous and intensely practical.
