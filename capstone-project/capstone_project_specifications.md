# Capstone Project: Advanced AI in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics

## 1. Overview

The capstone project is the culmination of the 12-month intensive program. It is a semester-long project that allows you to apply the knowledge and skills you have acquired to a real-world problem in AI-driven security. You will work in a team to propose, design, develop, and present a novel solution that addresses a significant challenge in the field.

## 2. Project Objectives

-   **Problem Solving:** Identify a real-world problem in cybersecurity or digital forensics that can be addressed with AI.
-   **Innovation:** Propose and develop an innovative solution that goes beyond existing tools and techniques.
-   **Teamwork:** Collaborate effectively in a team to manage a complex project from start to finish.
-   **Communication:** Communicate your ideas and results clearly and professionally through a written report and a final presentation.

## 3. Timeline and Milestones

| Week | Milestone | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Week 41** | Team Formation and Project Proposal | Form a team of 3-4 students and submit a 2-3 page project proposal. |
| **Week 44** | Design Document | Submit a detailed design document outlining the architecture and methodology of your project. |
| **Week 48** | Mid-term Progress Report and Demo | Present your progress to the instructional team and provide a demo of your prototype. |
| **Week 52** | Final Report, Code, and Presentation | Submit your final report, codebase, and deliver a final presentation and defense of your project. |

## 4. Deliverables

1.  **Project Proposal:** A document outlining the problem, your proposed solution, and the project scope.
2.  **Design Document:** A detailed technical document describing the architecture, data, models, and evaluation plan.
3.  **Source Code:** A well-documented and functional codebase for your project.
4.  **Final Report:** A comprehensive report (15-20 pages) that details your project, methodology, results, and conclusions.
5.  **Final Presentation:** A 20-minute presentation and a 10-minute Q&A session.

## 5. Grading Rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Innovation and Impact** | 25% | The novelty and potential impact of the proposed solution. |
| **Technical Execution** | 35% | The quality, correctness, and complexity of the implementation. |
| **Evaluation and Results** | 20% | The thoroughness of the evaluation and the significance of the results. |
| **Written Report** | 10% | The clarity, organization, and professionalism of the final report. |
| **Presentation** | 10% | The quality and effectiveness of the final presentation. |

## 6. Suggested Project Ideas

-   **Adversarial Attack and Defense:** Develop a new type of adversarial attack and a corresponding defense mechanism.
-   **AI for Threat Hunting:** Build an AI-powered tool to proactively hunt for threats in large datasets (e.g., network traffic, endpoint logs).
-   **Deepfake Detection:** Create a highly accurate deepfake detection system for video or audio.
-   **AI-Powered Deception:** Design an AI-driven deception environment (honeypot) to study and trap attackers.
-   **Automated Vulnerability Discovery:** Use machine learning to automatically discover vulnerabilities in source code.

## 7. Student Resources

A separate document will be provided with a list of recommended datasets, tools, and other resources to help you with your project.
