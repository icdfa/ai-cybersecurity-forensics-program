# Quarter 1, Month 3: Static & Dynamic Malware Analysis with AI

## Overview

This month covers malware analysis techniques using AI and machine learning. Students learn both static and dynamic analysis methods and build an intelligent malware detection system as the Quarter 1 mini-project.

## Lab Assignments

### Lab 3: Building an Intelligent Malware Detection System (Weeks 9-12)

This is the Quarter 1 mini-project. Students build an end-to-end malware detection system using machine learning, from data preparation through model deployment.

**Topics Covered:**
- Malware dataset preparation and exploration
- Feature engineering for malware classification
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Model comparison and selection
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment and persistence

**Deliverables:**
- Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis
- Trained malware detection model
- Lab report (3-5 pages) with findings
- Model comparison analysis

**Grading:** 100 points

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this month, students will be able to:

- Process and prepare large-scale malware datasets
- Engineer and select relevant features for malware classification
- Train, evaluate, and compare multiple machine learning models
- Fine-tune a model for optimal performance
- Develop a complete, functional malware detection tool
