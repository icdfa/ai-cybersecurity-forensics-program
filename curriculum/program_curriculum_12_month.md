    *   Week 9: Introduction to AI Ethics, Responsible AI Principles, Legal Frameworks (GDPR, etc.).
*   **Module 6: Static & Dynamic Malware Analysis with AI (Lab 3 - Enhanced)**
    *   Weeks 10-12: Static Feature Analysis, Introduction to Dynamic Analysis (Sandbox Concepts, Behavioral Features), Building an Intelligent Malware Classifier.
*   **Q1 Mini-Project:** Develop a complete malware classification system with a focus on feature engineering and model evaluation.

## Quarter 2: AI-Powered Digital Forensics & Incident Response

**Objective:** Apply AI and machine learning techniques to automate and enhance digital forensics investigations and incident response workflows.

*   **Module 7: Automated Forensic Analysis of Compromised Systems (Lab 4)**
    *   Weeks 13-16: Filesystem Analysis, Memory Forensics with Volatility, AI-driven artifact discovery.
*   **Module 8: Automated Attack Timeline Generation (Lab 5)**
    *   Weeks 17-20: Log Analysis with NLP, Event Correlation, Generating Attack Timelines.
*   **Module 9: AI-Powered Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) (Lab 6)**
    *   Weeks 21-24: Developing SOAR Playbooks, Automating Incident Response, Integrating AI decision-making.
*   **Q2 Mini-Project:** Build a SOAR playbook that uses an AI model to classify an incident and trigger an automated response.

## Quarter 3: Offensive AI & Adversarial Machine Learning

**Objective:** Understand and execute sophisticated attacks against AI systems to learn how to build more robust defenses.

*   **Module 10: Adversarial Attack Research & Evasion (Labs 7 & 8)**
    *   Weeks 25-28: Researching Latest Attacks, Evasion Techniques (FGSM, etc.), Bypassing ML Classifiers.
*   **Module 11: Data Poisoning & Backdoor Attacks (Lab 9)**
    *   Weeks 29-32: Poisoning Training Data, Creating Model Backdoors, Defending Against Data-Centric Attacks.
*   **Module 12: Deepfake Generation & Detection (Lab 10)**
    *   Weeks 33-36: Understanding GANs, Generating Deepfakes, Building a Deepfake Detection System.
*   **Q3 Mini-Project:** Execute a full red team exercise against a provided AI system, combining evasion and data poisoning attacks.

## Quarter 4: Advanced AI Security, Governance & Capstone Project

**Objective:** Master advanced AI security concepts, governance frameworks, and apply all learned skills in a comprehensive, real-world capstone project.

*   **Module 13: AI Red Teaming & Security Validation (Labs 11 & 12)**
    *   Weeks 37-40: Structured AI Red Teaming, Vulnerability Assessment, AI Security Validation & Certification.
*   **Module 14: AI Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) - Part 2**
    *   Weeks 41-42: NIST AI Risk Management Framework, ISO Standards, Auditing AI Systems.
*   **Module 15: SOC Simulation & Team-Based Incident Response (New Lab)**
