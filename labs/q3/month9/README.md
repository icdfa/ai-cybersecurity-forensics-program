# Quarter 3, Month 9: AI Red Teaming & Continuous AI Security Validation

## Overview

This month focuses on AI red teaming and the development of automated security validation pipelines for AI systems. Students conduct red team exercises and build continuous security testing frameworks.

## Lab Assignments

### Lab 11: Planning and Executing an AI Red Team Exercise (Weeks 33-34)

Simulate real-world attacks on AI systems to find vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

**Topics Covered:**
- Red teaming methodologies
- Attack simulation and planning
- Vulnerability identification
- Remediation recommendations

**Deliverables:**
- Red team plan and methodology
- Attack simulation results
- Lab report with findings

**Grading:** 100 points

### Lab 12: Building an Automated AI Security Validation Pipeline (Weeks 35-36)

Develop an automated pipeline to continuously test AI systems against known adversarial attacks.

**Topics Covered:**
- Security testing frameworks
- Automated attack integration
- Continuous monitoring
- Security validation reporting

**Deliverables:**
- Python implementation
- Validation pipeline
- Security reports

**Grading:** 100 points

This is the Quarter 3 mini-project.
